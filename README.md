## TO DO
there's a lot of missing verifications but I can't be bothered. These are configs not the main stuff.

make sure there are no name duplicates
handle bad tree ui in variations
Should have one add button with a dropdown that asks child or sibling
Should have collapse component
Should have search component
are all the backends calls necessary? Could update variations in front and send it clean to the back
DBService might need to be split into 4 services for each dataset
controller might need to be split into settings and workout
