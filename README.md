## TO DO
- Prizes of unlocking Exercises with on/off switch
- Custom workout - sometimes you workout with a friend, trainer or you are on vacation. So the workout becomes more random. It's more to log the workout than to do what is written
- Stats view
- Steroids functions that increase/decreases #sets based on how much you've been struggling
- progressivelly overload time of exercises
- add unloacked + muscle tag to search through exercises
- Fix mumbo jumbo of backend. There's definetly a cleaner way to write it. Find it.
