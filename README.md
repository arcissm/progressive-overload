## TO DO
there's a lot of missing verifications but I can't be bothered. These are configs not the main stuff.

- ribbon button to recal the calendar view
- custom workout - sometimes you workout with a friend, trainer or you are on vacation. So the workout becomes more random. It's more to log the workout than to do what is written
- Stats view
